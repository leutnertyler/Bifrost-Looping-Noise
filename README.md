# Bifrost-Looping-Noise
A library of looping noise nodes for Bifrost.

Install: 
-Place the contents of the "docs" folder inside your Bifrost docs location (C:\Users(username)\Autodesk\Bifrost\Compounds\docs)<\br>
-Place the contents of the "icons" folder inside your Bifrost icons location (C:\Users(username)\Autodesk\Bifrost\Compounds\icons)
-Place the contents of the "compounds" folder inside your Bifrost compounds location (C:\Users(username)\Autodesk\Bifrost\Compounds\compounds)

Note: If the time scale is too small and the loop frames isn't long enough, the noise will tend to go flat half way through. To fix this, increase the length of the loop and/or increase the time scale.
